Nobody pray for me
It′s been that day for me
Waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin′ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives; in fact, I'm downin' this
D′USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts

Girl, I can buy yo′ ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste buds?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin′ Tetris

A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil′ baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Bitch, be humble (hol′ up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, lil', hol′ up, lil′ bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol′ up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil′ bitch)

Be humble (hol' up, hol′ up)
Bitch, sit down (hol' up, hol' up, lil′ bitch)
Be humble (lil′ bitch, hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol′ up, hol' up, hol′ up, hol' up)

Be humble (hol′ up, hol' up)
Sit down (hol' up, hol′ up, lil′, hol' up, lil′ bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol′ up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil′ bitch)

Be humble (hol' up, hol' up)
Bitch, sit down (hol′ up, hol′ up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (lil′ bitch, hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol′ up, hol' up, hol′ up, hol' up)

Who dat nigga thinkin' that he frontin′ on Man-Man?
Get the fuck off my stage, I′m the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life

I′m so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin′ natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama′s couch in Polo socks

Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin′, ayy
I stay modest ′bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy

This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I′m the realest nigga after all

Bitch, be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol′ up, lil', hol′ up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol′ up, sit down, lil′, sit down, lil' bitch)

Be humble (hol′ up, hol' up)
Bitch, sit down (hol′ up, hol' up, lil′ bitch)
Be humble (lil' bitch, hol' up, bitch)
Sit down (hol′ up, hol′ up, hol' up, hol′ up)

Be humble (hol' up, hol′ up)
Sit down (hol' up, hol′ up, lil', hol' up, lil′ bitch)
Be humble (hol′ up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, sit down, lil′, sit down, lil' bitch)

Be humble (hol′ up, hol' up, hol′ up, hol' up)
Bitch, sit down (hol' up, hol′ up, lil′ bitch)
Be humble (lil' bitch, hol′ up, bitch)
Sit down (hol' up, hol′ up, hol' up, hol′ up)
