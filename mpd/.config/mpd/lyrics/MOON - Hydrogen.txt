Sometimes, I want the world to disappear
Cuz daytime and nighttime get obscured by my fears.
Even if we talk about the good parts of our lifeI am wondering if now is the time and our bad luck will strike

Walk away now
Cuz I′m lonely
Walk away now
Judge me poorly

It's the simple things that confuse me so,
It′s the everyday routine that cannot relieve me somehow

Walk away now
Cuz I'm lonely
Walk away now
Judge me poorly

Walk away now
Cuz I'm lonely
Walk away now
Judge me poorly

Cuz I′m not doing good
Cuz I′m not doing good

Walk away now
Cuz I'm lonely
Walk away now
Judge me poorly

Walk away now
Cuz I′m lonely
Walk away now
Judge me poorly

Walk away now...
Walk away now...
Walk away now...
