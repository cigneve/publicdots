I′m not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm having funI think I′m dumb, or maybe I'm just happy

I think I'm just happy
I think I′m just happy
I think I′m just happy

My heart is broke but I have some glue
Help me inhale and mend it with you
We'll float around and hang out on clouds
Then we′ll come down and have a hangover

We'll have a hangover
We′ll have a hangover
We'll have a hangover

Skin the sun, fall asleep
Wish away, soul is cheap
Lesson learned, wish me luck
Soothe the burn, wake me up

I′m not like them, but I can pretend
The sun is gone but I have a light
The day is done, but I'm having fun
I think I'm dumb, or maybe I′m just happy

I think I′m just happy
I think I'm just happy
I think I′m just happy

I think I'm dumb
I think I′m dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I′m dumb

I think I'm dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I′m dumb
I think I′m dumb

I think I'm dumb
I think I′m dumb
I think I'm dumb
I think I′m dumb
