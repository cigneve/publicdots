Skyless Kingdom of faceless apes
Sunless city and spineless shapes
In twenty seventy or so
Tenements on fire
Blazing through endless nights

Heavy downpours of charcoal rain
Spewing sewers and belching drains

In twenty seventy or so
Tenements on fire
Blazing through endless nights
And behind every spy hole
Car wrecks and barbed wire
Dirty streets and knife fights

Ruins and leavers everywhere
Fear of a pagan world
Behind the flames and the prayers
Soulless creatures burn

In twenty seventy or so
Tenements on fire
Blazing through endless nights
And behind every spy hole
(In the navel of God)
Car wrecks and barbed wire
Dirty streets and knife fights

In twenty seventy or so
(In the navel of God)
Car wrecks and barbed wire
In twenty seventy or so
(In the navel of God)
