Lost in skies of powdered gold
Caught in clouds of silver ropes
Showered by the empty hopesAs I tumble down
Falling fast to the ground

I know I′ll wither
So peel away the bark
Because nothing
Grows when it is dark
In spite of all my fears
I can see it all so clear
I see it all so clear

Cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones
That tremble down your spine
Cover your crystal eyes
And let your colors bleed
And blend with mine

Making waves in pitch black sand
Feel the salt dance on my hands
Raw and charcoal colored thighs
Feel so cold and my skin
Feels so paper-thin

I know I'll wither
So peel away the bark
Because nothing
Grows when it is dark
In spite of all my fears
I can see it all so clear
I see it all so clear

Cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that
Tremble down your spine
Cover your crystal eyes
And let your colors bleed
And blend with mine

But I′m ok
In see-through skin
I forgive what is within
Because I'm in this house
I'm in this home
All my time

Cover your crystal eyes
And feel the tones that
Tremble down your spine
Cover your crystal eyes
And let your colors bleed
And blend with mine
