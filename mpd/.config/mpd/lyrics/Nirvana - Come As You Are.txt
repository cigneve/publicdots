Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friendAs an old enemy

Take your time, hurry up
Choice is yours, don′t be late
Take a rest as a friend
As an old memoria

Memoria
Memoria
Memoria

Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old memoria

Memoria

Memoria

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don′t have a gun
No, I don't have a gun

Memoria

Memoria (No, I don't have a gun)

And I swear that I don′t have a gun
No, I don′t have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don′t have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
