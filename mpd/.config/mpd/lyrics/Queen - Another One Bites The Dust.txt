Ooh, let′s go

Steve walks warily down the streetWith the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go

Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway, the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I′m gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along?
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own

Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, look out

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I′m gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

Hey

Oh, take it
Bite the dust
Bite the dust

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey, hey
Another one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh

(Ooh, shut up)

There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him when he′s down, yeah

But I'm ready, yes, I′m ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat, oh, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I′m gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

Shoot out
Ay-yeah
Alright
