She keeps Moët et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake," she saysJust like Marie Antoinette

A built-in remedy
For Kruschev and Kennedy
At any time, an invitation
You can′t decline

Caviar and cigarettes
Well-versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (anytime)

Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite, wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness

Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again, incidentally
If you′re that way inclined

Perfume came, naturally, from Paris
Cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious, precise

She's a killer queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (anytime)
