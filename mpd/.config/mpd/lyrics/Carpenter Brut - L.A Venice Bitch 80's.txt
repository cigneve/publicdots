Is it a new sweater, or your old one just turned to red?
Are you menstruating right now, or your future child is now born dead?
Can I practice for an hour, my favorite hobby on your head?I just need your scalp, and one of your eyes in my hand.

I can call by the look in your eyes,
You like it bleeding, dirty, ending in a crowd of dead bodies.
And I can read it from the blood in your hands.
The Good Old Call of the kitchen knife...
Of the kitchen knife...

I yearn to hear children suffocating.

Aims for head all missed, just go for the kid.
Excuse me miss, can′t you keep your child quiet?
I won't be able to cut out his tongue, if he keeps on moving like a mad-man

I know it isn′t right, I know I hurt people
But I cannot resist, The Good Old Call.
I know it isn't right, I know I hurt people
But no-one can resist, The Good Old Call.

...of a kitchen knife...
...of the kitchen knife!

I can call by the look in your eyes,
You like it bleeding, dirty, ending in a crowd of dead bodies.
And I can read it from the blood in your hands.
The Good Old Call of the kitchen knife...
Of the kitchen knife...

We live for show when the audience scared to death
When they know there's no happy ending,
And they′ve been corrected...
We live for show when the audience scared to death
When they know there′s no happy ending.
And they've been corrected

The Good Old Call of a kitchen...
Good Old Call of a kitchen knife...

I can call by the look in your eyes,
You like it bleeding, dirty, ending in a crowd of dead bodies.
And I can read it from the blood in your hands.
The Good Old Call of the kitchen knife...
Of the kitchen knife...
Of the kitchen knife...
Of the kitchen-
